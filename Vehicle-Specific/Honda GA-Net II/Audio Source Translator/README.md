# Supported Modules
Supports all Honda GA-Net II CD changers, cassette decks, and XM tuners. Also supports the IMID module in the 2012-2015 Civic and likely the 2012-2016 CR-V.

## TODO
* Support for IMID in other vehicles
* Single CD drive
* Non-integrated radio module (e.g. Ridgeline with navigation)
* Sirius tuners with fixed XM1 and XM2 presets
