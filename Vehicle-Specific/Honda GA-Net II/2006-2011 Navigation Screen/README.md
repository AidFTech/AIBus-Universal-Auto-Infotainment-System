# 2006-2011 Navigation Screen
This component uses the base, tilt motor, and button pannel of the navigation screen from a 2006-2011 Civic for a monitor. It will fit in any vehicle with a double-DIN opening, and allows for an audio accessory (e.g. CD changer or tape deck) in the top DIN slot, revealed by the screen tilting forward.

***This component is still a work in progress.***
